I am starting to use 
webpack.js.org
the webpack.js is a result of using web pack after providing 
webpack.config.js 

from 

webpack.js.org 

and example from 

http://www.matthiassommer.it/software-architecture/webpack-node-modules/
(the example is flawed in a sense that it adds unnecessary quotation marks btw)

and adding

mode:'development'

and then running 

webpack 

in this directory location which creates webpack.js in

./node_modules/webpack/bin
